### Pointers for everyday practive.

Pick a specific plan.

It can even be a mix of your goals.

Have them in priority.

Have a dedicated time slot every day to remind yourself. 

It would be impactful if you do this consistently everday at a specific time. 

Good to do it right after you wake up and right before you go to sleep. 

Be seated in your comfortable posture. SPINE ERECT!

Close your eyes.

Start observing your breath. 

If thoughts disturb you ask yourself what is your next thought going to be?

Observe the silence between thoughts. 

If they keep coming just observe them. Don't try to judge them. 

Observe your thoughts and slowly go back to observing your breath. 

Take a deep breath IN. 

Let it out slowly. As slowly as humanly possible. 

Your breath needs to flow with ease. 

You should not be able to hear your own breath. 

Do it for 2 or 3 times. 

Now inhale deeply. 

When you feel you have inhaled to your capacity. Take two more sharp breath ins. 

And let your breath flow out with ease. 

Do this two times. 

Observe the silence. 

**Start Your Reminder**
